# N-Queens-Visualizer

This project visualizes the solution of the N-Queens problem using PyQt5 for the user interface and Pygame for the graphical representation. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a queen can attack another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.


# Features

Interactive Input: Users can input the number of queens and choose the visualization speed.

Visualization: Provides a visual representation of how the algorithm places queens on the chessboard.

All Solutions: Option to visualize all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.


# Technologies Used

PyQt5: Used for creating the interactive input window.

Pygame: Used for rendering the chessboard and queen images, as well as handling the graphical representation of the algorithm.


# How to Use

Input Window:

Enter the number of queens.

Select the visualization speed using the slider.

Click "Start" to begin the visualization.


# Visualization

Upon clicking "Start," the program will display the N-Queens solution process.

Queens will be placed on the chessboard, and the program will highlight conflicts.

It will display all possible solutions for the given input one by one.
